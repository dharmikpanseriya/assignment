    "Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, functions help to organize and modularize our code, making it easier to read and \n",
    "understand. By breaking our code into smaller, self-contained units, we can make our programs \n",
    "more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, functions can help us to avoid repeating the same code over and over again. Instead of \n",
    "writing the same code multiple times, we can define a function once and then call it whenever \n",
    "we need to perform that particular task. This makes our code more efficient and reduces the \n",
    "risk of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, functions can make our code more reusable. Once we have defined a function, we can use \n",
    "it in multiple programs and even share it with other developers. This allows us to reuse and \n",
    "build upon our own code, as well as the code of others."
